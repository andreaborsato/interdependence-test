   <div class="titoletti" id="titoletto-economy">Economy and Supply Chain</div>
   <div class="theme-description">Towards innovative paradigms. Understanding today’s economy, orienting that of the future.
    A dense network of economic, commercial, and financial relationships connects companies, industries, 
    and nations. Design is an integral part of the economy, but it has the vision to read the interactions between the players involved and each choice's domino 
    effect. Valuable interdisciplinarity to develop new strategies and paradigms.

   <div class="titoletti" id="titoletto-commons">Commons</div>
   <div class="theme-description">
    Vital resources for all. A use to be designed in an equitable and participatory way. The public space we inhabit, 
    the water, the air, the energy we consume, the infrastructure we use are deeply interdependent. 
    Because the commons belong to everyone and concern everyone’s life. Design can shape these resources and their use as equitably, shared 
    and participatory as possible.

   <div class="titoletti" id="titoletto-culture">Culture and Information</div>
   <div class="theme-description">
    Contamination, exchange, sharing. Imagining and facilitating unexplored directions. Cultures shape worlds 
    and values by interacting with each other on a global scale. Data and information, through media platforms, influence public opinion and educational systems. Design, with its natural interdisciplinarity, can catalyze new forms of collaboration 
    and sharing.

   <div class="titoletti" id="titoletto-ecology">Ecology and Natural Resources</div>
   <div class="theme-description">
    Nature is us. Coexistence is to be designed with balance and harmony. Orienting that of the future. In nature, relationships are life. Organisms, ecosystems, 
    and communities interact with each other through delicate and dynamic balances. 
    The challenge of design is to understand and address the impact of human activities for a sustainable management of resources that preserves 
    the richness of biodiversity for all benefit.

   <div class="titoletti" id="titoletto-technology">Technology</div>
   <div class="theme-description">
    Impact and humanization of technologies. Drawing new balances and horizons of meaning. Each technology is closely connected to all others 
    and people’s everyday life. Every innovation in one area has an impact in shaping the overall technological landscape in which we are immersed. Design offers a way 
    to humanize technologies and to explore ethical issues related to technological advances.

   <div class="titoletti" id="titoletto-politics">Politics and Society</div>
   <div class="theme-description">   
    The complexity of global challenges. Designing unprecedented paths of dialogue and encounter. From security to cooperation, from international diplomacy 
    to peace building, political and national entities depend on each other. A map of relationships in flux, where design has much to say 
    and do, creating contexts for dialogue and helping to manage and alleviate emergencies and conflict situations.

   <div class="titoletti" id="titoletto-wellbeing">Wellbeing</div>
   <div class="theme-description">
    Human relations, values and quality of life. Facilitating positive interactions. Individual and group relationships, strong and weak ties between people, and the exchange between generations shape social structures and the way values and visions are transmitted and evolve. 
    Design is a powerful agent of interactions, addressing relationships in their essence for the well-being of individuals and communities.

   <div class="titoletti" id="titoletto-food">Food Resources</div>
   <div class="theme-description">
    Food and planet. Reformulating food habits and production from a sustainable perspective. Between nature and industry, between local traditions and global policies, the way we produce, distribute and consume food has an impact on our well-being and that 
    of the planet. In its history, design has already intervened in the dynamics of agri-food systems, which are increasingly interconnected, and today 
    it can help reinvent them according to more 
    sustainable logic.
